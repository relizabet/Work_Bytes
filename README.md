## About the Project

For this assignment we were asked to meet the following criteria:

    Must use at least two server-side APIs
    Must use a CSS framework _other than_ Bootstrap
    Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)
    Use at least one new third-party API
    Must have a polished UI
    Must meet good quality coding standards
    Does not use alerts, confirms or prompts (look into _modals_)
    Must be deployed to GitHub Pages

As a group we came up with the following user story for our application:

    GIVEN I am using a job search website I can search for jobs
    WHEN I put what city I want a job in
    THEN I am presented with details of available jobs in that city
    WHEN the list of available jobs appears
    THEN I can apply to the available job presented
    THEN I can click the jobs to see nearby restaurants
    WHEN presented with nearby restaurants
    THEN I can click on a restaurant to view details and read reviews
    WHEN I check the save job checkbox
    THEN the job is added to save for my next visit
    WHEN I click the saved jobs link
    THEN I can see the jobs I saved from the last session
    WHEN I uncheck the saved job
    THEN the job is unsaved when I refresh the page

## Challenges

- **Unusable APIs** - original idea was to help developers find jobs based on their personalities, but both of the API's were unusable
  Traitify - Never provided with an API key
  GitJobs - couldn't connect to the API without a server
- **GitHub** - we ran into a few hiccups collaborating in regards to:
  Merging, pulling code, pushing, errors, etc.
  The best thing we did was protect the master branch from anyone directly pushing code to it

## Wins

**Great Team**

- Collaborating through the code
- Resolving issues with our API's

**Support!**
